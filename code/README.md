# Codes Sequence

### **Do read the codes in the order below, so as to understand better on the codes and thought process.**


**1) Project 1 - SAT and ACT scores analysis**


This code is to state the problem statement and background of the project. 


Followed by some coding challenges to demonstrate the ability to use Python in writing essential functions and codes.

Then, processes are being done to import the 2 datasets (sat_2019_ca & act_2019_ca) and clean the data. 

It is followed by multiple EDAs done to understand the dataset better.

Then, multiple data visualizations are being done to gain insights to the data. and produce recommendations.

Lastly, based on the insights aboce, conclusions and recommendations are being given.


**2) Appendix - Data Dictionary**


This code is the data dictionary for all the variables in the 2 final datasets (2019_SAT_California & 2019_ACT_California) , for better understanding of what the items in the excel dataset mean.
